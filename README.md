# Machine Learning Project: Predicting Housing Prices

This project is to predict housinig prices participating the Kaggle project, [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) using the dataset from the competition. 

The project was initially done by a group of people (Team JAWS (Jason Lai, Arthur Yu, Will Thurston, Soomin Park) from a NYC Data Science Academy cohort. My contribution was pre-processing/cleaning the dataset, and building linear models(regularized linear models, such as Ridge, Lasso, and the ElasticNet regressions) on the data. The process of the data cleaning/modeling and the results from the models are summarized in [this blogpost](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/predicting-housing-prices-in-ames-iowa-2/). 

After finishing the team work, I personally added more work on developing decision trees models and ensembles (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and stacking, and raised the Kaggle leaderboard score more. The codes are in the [project3/Soomin](https://github.com/juliepark7/project3/tree/master/Soomin) folder(*currently being organized*).
